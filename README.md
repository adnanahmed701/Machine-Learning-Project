# Machine-Learning-Project
Using data from historical Olympic games to try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data

# Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which we'll also follow here. 

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.


File overview:

* `machine_learning.ipynb` - the main project code
* `data_prep.ipynb` - the code to generate the team-level dataset from an athlete-level dataset
